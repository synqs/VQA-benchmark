# Decomposition of unitary evolution operator into two-level unitary matrices

These scripts store and test the decomposition of the mixing evolution operator for TSP on 3x3 qubits I calculated by hand.

They can be retrieved with `from decomposition import two_levels`.
In the main file you find the decomposition of the 6x6-dimensional blocks, in `decomposition3.py` of the 3x3-dimensional blocks.

They also print latex code for printing the matrices. This is best used by `decomposition.py > decomposition.tex`.
