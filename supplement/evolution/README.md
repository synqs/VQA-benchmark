# Understanding of higher orders of mixing Hamiltonians

With this script I tried to figure out how the powers of mixing Hamiltonians for the TSP looks like.
For 2x2 and 3x3 qubits they become quickly repetitive, but for higher orders not so.
Is it possible to find simple patterns for (all) higher orders?
