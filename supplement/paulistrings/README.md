# Decomposition of unitary evolution operator into Pauli-matrices

With this script I figured out how the mixing Hamiltonian for the TSP looks like in terms of Pauli matrices.
It is indeed not arbitrarily complicated and bases on SWAP = 1/2 (II + XX + YY + ZZ).
For further context refer to the associated Master thesis.
